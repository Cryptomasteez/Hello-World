# Hello-World
As time goes by my mind wonders further into the unknown and yet I pause to secure a glimpse of time.

I go by Cryptomasteez, I am a huge fan of Blockchain technology and from all I've seen and read I have grown to love the stuff.  I am far from being a programmer but I am intrigued enough to learn Blockchain creating programs. What I have on my side to learn the subject of programing is perserverance, my eagerness to accomplish, my will to learn, and the sacrifice of time to the subject. Recently I have written lines of code using, HTML, CSS, JS, Python and soon Solidity and now learning my way around Github to set things in motion.

I am jumping around but only to have a feel of what is to come.  I would love to hear opinions and advice on other steps you all have taken to writing code in the field of Blockchain technology from the pros to cons.  

Wish me luck on my path to accomplishing a educational challenge.
