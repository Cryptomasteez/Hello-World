# Hello-World
As time goes by my mind wonders further into the unknown and yet I pause to secure a glimpse of time.

I go by Cryptomasteez, I am a huge fan of Blockchain technology and from all I've seen and read I have grown to love the stuff.  I am far from being a programmer but what I have on my side to learn the subject is perserverance. My eagerness to accomplish, my will to learn, and the sacrifice of time to the subject is what will take me to the point of creating a token maybe even my own blockchain coin. Being on Github is the on first step to learning my way around. Have recently written lines of code using, HTML, CSS, JS, Python and soon Solidity.  I am jumping around but only to have a feel of what is to come.  Wish me luck on my path to accomplishing a educational challenge.
